History of the wells, what are they?
Who is doing which model?
Talk about architectures on How Does Deep Learning Work?
Testing set on why 3 datasets?
Different parameters to optimize
Challenges in optimization
Different recurrent neural network table and performances
CONCLUSIONS
Remind what info train and predict
Future directions add graph of oil, water, gas
Cost and what we are trying to minimize
Add in baseline model
Four graphs in one slide and put costs inside, remove Chunk Data label
